About: 	If this script name is suffixed with META, when executed it will automatically spawn 
	all individual scripts included in the package into the directory of the META script
	and will import them into the Action list from that directory.  
	That's provided such scripts don't exist yet, if they do, then in order to recreate 
	them they have to be deleted from the Action list and from the disk first.  

	If there's no META suffix in this script name, it will perfom the operation indicated 
	in its name.

	The script puts into keyboard focus in the open Media Item Property dialogue a property
	of selected item, indicated in the script name, so it's accessible for keyboard input. 
	Text fields will be accessible for typing, drop-down and pop-up menus will be accessible 
	for navigation with up/down arrow keys. If the dialogue is closed it will be opened by 
	the script.
	
	The script is known to work on Windows.
