Version: 1.0
Changelog: #Initial release
Licence: WTFPL
REAPER: 7.12 and newer
Extensions: SWS/S&M
Provides: [main=main,media_explorer]
			. > BuyOne_Move selection start in Media Explorer player right by X ms.lua
			. > BuyOne_Move selection start in Media Explorer player left by X ms.lua
			. > BuyOne_Move selection end in Media Explorer player right by X ms.lua

About:	If this script name is suffixed with META it will spawn 
			all individual scripts included in the package into the 
			directory of the META script and will import them into 
			the Action list from that directory. That's provided such 
			scripts don't exist yet, if they do, then in order to 
			recreate them they have to be deleted from the Action list 
			and from the disk first.  
			If there's no META suffix in this script name it will perfom 
			the operation indicated in its name.			
			
			The script doesn't create undo points.
						
			If the current script contains the word 'start' in its name
			it can be used to move MX player playback start position. 
			If there's no selection it will be created automatically
			as soon as the selection start position change.
			
			If the current script contains the word 'mousewheel' in its 
			name, it can be run with the mousewheel only if installed in 
			the Main section of the Action list. For the mousewheel input 
			to be registered the Media Explorer window, Arrange or Track 
			must be focused but not the Media Explorer player because 
			this switches mousewheel focus to the player scrollbar.  
			The mousewheel input isn't registered by the script instance 
			installed in the Media Explorer section.  
			Mousewheel direction is in/down - left, out/up - right.
