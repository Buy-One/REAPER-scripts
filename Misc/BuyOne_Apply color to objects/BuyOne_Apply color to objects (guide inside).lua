ReaScript name: BuyOne_Apply color to objects (guide inside).lua
Author: BuyOne
Website: https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=134058 or https://github.com/Buy-One/REAPER-scripts/issues
Version: 1.0
Changelog: #Initial release
Licence: WTFPL
REAPER: at least v5.962
About: 	The script is designed to be a one stop shop for object coloration 
	in REAPER. It colors objects with selected color according to 3 
	criteria: being encolsed within razor edit area, within time selection 
	and being selected.  
	The objects are project markers and regions, take markers, items/takes
	and tracks.  
	The criteria are evaluated in the following order: razor edit areas,
	time selection, item selection, track selection. When one criterion
	is not met, the next one is evaluated.  
	Thus first objects within razor areas are targeted, absent razor 
	edit areas objects within time selection are targeted, absent time 
	selection selected items are targeted and absent selected items 
	selected tracks are targeted.
	
	Razor edit areas are relevant for project markers and regions and take
	markers. To color these enclose them within razor edit areas. The 
	multiplicity of razor edit ares allows coloration of non-contiguous 
	objects. For region color to be affected by the script its start or 
	end ust be enclosed within a razor edit area or coincide with either 
	of its edges. The same applies to markers with the exception of the 
	end which they don't have. In multi-take items all take markers in all 
	takes are affected as long as they fall within razor edit area bounds.
	
	For project markers and regions and take markers time selection is also 
	relevant, however time selection only allows coloring non-contiguos
	objects. Like in the case of razor edit areas objects must be either
	encolsed within time selection or conicide with either of its edges.
	To affect take markers the item must be selected. In multi-take items 
	only markers in the active take are affected.
	
	Item selection only relevant for items and track selection is only 
	relevant for tracks. By default if item consists of multiple takes
	the color is applied to the active take. This can be changed in the
	USER SETTINGS.   

	
	Select target objects using the means described above and run the script.
	When the script is executed it calls a color picker. Select the color
	and click OK to apply it or Cancel to abort. If the color is selected 
	from the spectrum box make sure to adjust the vertical slider because
	by default it points at the black end of the spectrum.  
	While the color picker is open selection type and target objects can be 
	changed because it doesn't block REAPER UI.	
	
	When selected items are being colored they will appear blinking once.
	That's done on purpose to reveal the new color, because depending on
	the theme selection color may mask the actual item/take color, so without
	temporarily clearing the selection automatically, in order to assess the
	coloration result the selection would have to be cleared manually and then
	re-stored if the result wasn't satistactory.
	
	
	If you happen to forget what criteria are applied to which object 
	type, run the script with a shortcut having placed the mouse cursor 
	within 100 px of the left edge of the screen (not REAPER window) to 
	display a hint. The hint can only be displayed before the color picker 
	has been loaded.  
	
	The color picker doesn't keep the last selected color and always starts
	at default settings, therefore if you wish to apply the same color which 
	was applied previously you can look up its RGB values in the Undo point
	description.

-- Enable by inserting any alphanumeric character

-- color the entire item regardless of the number
-- of takes it consists of, which for multi-take items
-- will mean the same color for all takes because
-- if they have custom color it will be reset;
-- the applied color will also be default color
-- for all new takes which don't have custom color;
-- if the setting isn't enabled here, it can be toggled
-- via menu if the script is run with a shortcut while
-- the mouse cursor is located within 100 px of the
-- left edge of the screen (not REAPER window);
-- the state of the setting changed via the menu
