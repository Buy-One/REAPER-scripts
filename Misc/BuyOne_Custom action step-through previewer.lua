ReaScript name: BuyOne_Custom action step-through previewer.lua
Author: BuyOne
Website: https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=134058 or https://github.com/Buy-One/REAPER-scripts/issues
Version: 1.0
Changelog: #Initial release
Licence: WTFPL
REAPER: recommended 6.71 or newer
Extensions: SWS/S&M unless REAPER build is 6.71 or newer
About: 	The script allows importing/replicating custom actions
	to run them step by step while monitoring the progress
	either to debug existing custom actions or to build new
	ones from scratch.  
	
	Actions supposed to be run with the mousewheel cannot
	be tested with this script.
	
	When the script is launched its click pad box will be 
	opened. Left-click inside the box will call the script
	menu interface. To be able to use the script the box must 
	stay open. It can be closed when not needed. To close the 
	click pad box press Escape key when it's focused or click 
	the close button at its upper right-hand corner. 
	On re-opening the clock pad box window is opened at its last 
	location, not at the mouse cursor.  
	The latest configuration is saved and will be available 
	during the same REAPER session. The script doesn't store 
	any data outside of the current session so in each new 
	session it will start out completely reset.  
	If you wish to make the custom action available to the
	script in subsequent sessions export is as an .ReaperKeyMsp
	file (see EXPORTING THE CUSTOM ACTION paragraph below).
	

	ADDING CUSTOM ACTION TO THE SCRIPT
	
	There're 2.5 ways to add a custom action to the script:
	1a. To import it by supplying its command ID taken from the
	Action list (right click -> Copy selected action command ID);  
	1b. To import it from a .ReaperKeyMap file;  
	2. To add by arming actions one by one.
	
	To import use IMPORT CUSTOM ACTION option. To import from 
	a .ReaperKeyMap file submit the import dialogue empty to call
	a file browser.  
	If the script menu alerady contains a list of actions imported
	or added earlier, deleting them prior to the import is not
	necessary because the import option will allow to replace
	them with the imported ones.
	
	In order to be able to add an armed action 
	1. Enable the ADD ARMED ACTION option
	2. Open the Action list and arm the target action,
	as soon as it's armed it will be added to the action sequence
	after the checkmarked action item and immediately unarmed, 
	if no action is checkmarked it will be added to the bottom 
	of the list unless this behavior is changed in the 
	USER SETTINGS. The newly created action item doesn't get
	checkmarked which can be changed in the USER SETTINGS. 
	Actions cannot be added with the Action list closed even 
	by arming them via a toolbar.  
	While the armed action is being added, the script menu will be 
	closed because it has lost the mouse focus, but will open as 
	soon as a new action has been added, to reflect the change.  
	While ADD ARMED ACTION option is enabled the option RUN ACIONS
	which triggers the actions will be inactive.		
	
	Only import/addition of actions belonging to the Main, MIDI Editor 
	and MIDI Event List sections of the Action list is supported. 
	
	When importing from .ReaperKeyMap file containing multiple custom 
	actions only the first found custom action will be imported.
	
	When importing a custom action via the dialogue on top of the 
	existing list of actions and opting for 'Append' option, the custom
	action sequence will be added after the last action entry of the 
	current list. When adding actions to the existing list by arming
	they're added after the ckeckmarked action entry and if there's
	none they're added after the last action entry.
	
	The initial import/addition determine the association with the 
	Action list section for all actions appended later to the existing 
	list of actions, that is the newly added actions must belong to the 
	same Action list section as the first imported custom action or 
	the first action added by arming. Actions from other sections will 
	be rejected. 
	
	
	ACTION MANAGEMENT OPTIONS
	
	Once custom action has been imported or a list of actions 
	has been built the individual action entries can be managed 
	with the management options hidden in the OPERATION submenu.  
	These are enabled and disabled automatically depending on the 
	state of the list of actions and their total number.  
	To be able to affect an action entry in the list with the 
	management options checkmark it.  
	The management options can be exploded to the main menu for
	ease of access with 'Explode list menagement menu' item, which 
	is especially convenient when an action needs to be moved more 
	than one position in any direction.  
	The MOVE ACTION UP/DOWN operation is circular.
	
	The script allows disabling action items which will prevent
	execution of actions linked to them when the sequence is
	stepped through, they will be skipped instead. Disabled action
	items can be stored with the exported .ReaperKeyMap file and 
	re-disabled when the file is imported into the script. 
	On a 64 bit system a maximum of first 63 actions can be stored, 
	while on a 32 bit system it's the first 52 actions.
	
	
	EXECUTING THE CUSTOM ACTION
	
	The execution is performed by repetative clicking on the 
	RUN ACTIONS menu item. 
	To run MIDI Editor and MIDI Event List actions the MIDI Editor 
	must be open.
	The entry of the latest excuted action gets checkmarked in 
	the list. 
	In order to start the execution from the top no action item 
	in the list must be checkmarked. The only way to achieve that 
	is by un-checkmarking the very last action item in the list which 
	is the only one whose checkmark can be toggled. So if not 
	initially checkmarked its checkmark must be toggled to On to 
	clear checkmark from any other action item and then to Off. 
	Otherwise the action sequence is executed from the currently 
	checkmarked action item, unless it's the last one because  
	the execution cannot go past the last action item.  
	
	During action sequence execution the checkmark indicates the 
	latest excuted action.
	
	Disabled actions are skipped during the sequence execution.
	
	
	UNDOING
	
	Undo operation always runs from the last action executed
	by the script regardless of the currently checkmarked action 
	item. It's possible to shuttle between RUN ACTIONS and UNDO 
	operations back and forth without reaching the end of the 
	custom action sequence.
	
	To undo MIDI Editor and MIDI Event List actions with the 
	script the MIDI Editor must be open.
	
	The UNDO menu item stays inactive as long as the latest undo
	point in REAPER undo history was not created by this script.
	It's activated when action sequence execution starts.
	The UNDO menu item is deactivated as soon as the the first undo 
	point created by the script has been undone, if action sequence 
	execution is interrupted by other REAPER operations which create 
	their own undo points, or if the undo point index doesn't match
	the action position in the sequence which can happen if the 
	actions have been reordered. 
	
	During undoing of the action sequence the checkmark indicates 
	action preceding the latest undone action, that is the latest 
	not yet undone.
	
	Of course custom action steps can be undone by conventional 
	means while the menu us closed. 
	
	When undo is being performed by means other than the script, i.e. 
	while the menu is closed, checkmark is not moved to the latest
	not yet undone action and stays where it was before the menu was
	exited. When the action sequence has been fully undone, i.e. when 
	the undo point preceding the 1st undo point created by the script
	in REAPER undo history has been reached, the checkmark is cleared 
	from action items regardless of the way undo has been performed.


	EXPORTING THE CUSTOM ACTION
	
	The action sequence is exported from the script as a custom 
	action with 'EXPORT as .ReaperKeyMap' option.  
	On export the custom action command ID and name are determined 
	by the command ID and name of the initially imported custom 
	action. If the action sequence was built by arming actions,
	on the very first export the command ID will be generated 
	automatically while the name of the exported custom action will
	be user chosen, and both will be preserved in the memory for 
	future exports until all actions are deleted, a new custom action
	is imported deleting the current one or REAPER session is finished.  
	The exported .ReaperKeyMap file is placed in the /KeyMaps folder 
	inside REAPER resource directory being named after the custom
	action.  
	Export of a custom action imported via its command ID from the 
	Action list without any changes to the order or array of the 
	actions it's made up of is prevented because it makes no sense. 
	Such custom action can be exported directly from the Action list.
	
	
	RUN ACTIONS and ADD ARMED ACTION options sre mutually exclusive.
	
	
	Quick access shortcuts (the register is immaterial):
	
	(UN)DISABLE MARKED ACTION	- n
	MOVE MARKED ACTION UP		- p
	MOVE MARKED ACTION DOWN		- d
	RUN ACTIONS			- r
	UNDO				- u
	
	They're underscored in the menu.
	
	
	CAVEATS
	
	The script doesn't support actions whose functionality depends
	on mouse cursor position because when it's executed the mouse
	cursor is engaged with the actions sequence menu.
	
	The script usability is limited by the screen resolution because
	only so many menu items can be visible at once. If the menu size
	cannot fit within the screen height the extra items will only
	be accessible by scrolling the menu which besides being 
	enconvenient makes using the script impractical because when the
	menu is reloaded after each click to stay visible its scroll state
	is reset and the item just accessed will again become hidden and
	requiring scrolling.  
	At screen height resolution of 768 px a max of 36 action items are 
	visible in the menu. For every additional 17 px one more action item 
	can be displayed, conversely, every reduction by 17 px will result 
	in one fewer visible action item.
