ReaScript name: BuyOne_Cycle switch last focused toolbar to next or previous.lua
Author: BuyOne
Website: https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=134058 or https://github.com/Buy-One/REAPER-scripts/issues
Version: 1.0
Changelog: Initial release
Licence: WTFPL
REAPER: at least v5.962
Extensions: SWS/S&M or js_ReaScriptAPI recommended
About: 	▒ THE CONCEPT

	The script only works when exactly one toolbar is open in 
	the relevant context (besides main toolbars), that is either 
	in Arrange or in the MIDI Editor contexts, thus at any given 
	moment it only tolerates the total of two open toolbars.   
	If several toolbars per context were allowed, then when cycling 
	would reach another toolbar already open, the latter would be 
	auto-closed and the focused toolbar content would be switched 
	to it, which is messy.  
	The script is designed to allow freeing up some screen real estate 
	by always having only one toolbar open per context so using it 
	with multiple toolbars also defeats its purpose.
	
	To be able to use the script in the MIDI Editor context it must
	be imported into the MIDI Editor section of the Action list as well.
	To be able to switch to a MIDI toolbar and switch between MIDI 
	toolbars the MIDI Editor must be active, that is have keyboard focus 
	for which it's enough to click anywhere within it. When the MIDI 
	Editor is first open it becomes active automatically. Once the MIDI 
	Editor is closed Arrange context automatically becomes active. 
	While the MIDI Editor is open contexts can be switched by clicking
	within the Arrange or the MIDI Editor.
	
	▒ SETTING THE FOCUS
	
	If the extensions are installed a toolbar appropriate for the context 
	is brought into focus automatically, so no additional moves are 
	required. Otherwise the script targets the last focused toolbar 
	regardless of whether it is visibly focused currently (whether its 
	title bar is colorized) and whether any other window (other than 
	a toolbar) is focused (its title bar is colorized).   
	To bring a floating toolbar into focus its body or the title bar must 
	be clicked, this also applies to a toolbar docked in a floating docker.   
	To bring into focus a toolbar docked in a docker attached to the main 
	window its body must be clicked (it doesn't have a title bar), clicking 
	a docked toolbar tab doesn't change focus.
	
	▒ WAYS TO RUN THE SCRIPT

	If you prefer to run the script with a shortcut there're two options
	which are dictated by the fact that keyboard input is blocked when
	a toolbar is visibly in focus, that is when its title bar is colorized
	(REAPER limitation https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=279932).
	The position of the mouse cursor is immaterial.

	1) On the one hand you can make the scope of the shortcut in the Main
	section of the Action list global which allows running the script in
	Arrange context regardless of a toolbar being in focus. However in this
	case the shortcut the script is bound to in the MIDI Editor section of
	the Action list must be different otherwise the global shortcut will
	have priority and you won't be able to run the script from the MIDI
	Editor context (global scope isn't supported for MIDI Editor section
	shortcuts).  
	When extensions are installed the toolbar is never left in focus 
	therefore using a shortcut with global scope is pointless.   
	2) On the other hand the script can be bound to identical non-global
	shortcuts in both contexts but then to be able to run the script the
	toolbar will have to be explcitly not in focus.    
	In both abovelisted scenarios when the MIDI Editor is open the focus 
	must be set manually to either the Arrange or the MIDI Editor window 
	by clicking them, depending on the context you wish to manipulate the 
	toolbar in. When the MIDI Editor is closed the script defaults to the 
	Arrange context.  
	
	The limitation stemming from a toolbar being in focus doesn't apply to 
	toolbars docked in the floating docker in Arrange context because visual 
	focus of the docker window doesn't inhibit the functionality. Neither 
	does the aforementioned limitation apply to the mousewheel but there's 
	another detailed in the description of the MOUSEWHEEL setting in the 
	USER SETTINGS.

	The script cannot be run from a toolbar button in the main toolbar
	in either context, becuse main toolbar can be switched as well if
	comes into focus which happens exactly at the moment of a button click
	and the script has a safeguard against switching the main toolbar
	to another one because this is likely not what you'd want happening.
	Running the script with a button on all other toolbars though possible
	doesn't make much sense because this way you might as well run native
	'switch to toolbar' actions, although admittedly to be able to switch
	back and forth two buttons will be needed which takes additional space.	
	
	▒ LAST ACTIVE TOOLBAR STORAGE
	
	The script stores the last open toolbar for each context and opens it 
	for such context if a toolbar appropriate for it is not already open. 
	If no toolbar has been stored yet for a context, toolbar 1 will be opened. 
	To store these data with the project file so that they're available in 
	the next session make sure to save the project at least before closing it.

-- Enable by placing any alphanumeric character between

-- contexts;
-- when context change is detected, a toolbar appropriate
-- for the incoming context gets opened while toolbar appropriate
-- for the outgoing context gets closed or the latter is switched
-- to the former;
-- if extensions aren't installed this is more  convenient than
-- having two toolbars always open, one for each context, because
-- this is more likely to ensure that the same toolbar stays in
-- focus all the time and the script doesn't generate focus related
-- error messages, provided you don't manually open a toolbar from
