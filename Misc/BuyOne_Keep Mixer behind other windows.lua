ReaScript name: BuyOne_Keep Mixer behind other windows.lua
Author: BuyOne
Website: https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=134058 or https://github.com/Buy-One/REAPER-scripts/issues
Version: 1.0
Changelog: #Initial release
Licence: WTFPL
REAPER: at least v5.962
Extensions: SWS/S&M
About:	The use case for this script is mixing with open and
	floating Mixer and preventing the Mixer window from 
	obscuring floating plugin windows when it or the MCP 
	is brought into focus, by automatically pushing it to 
	background. Because using pin in the plugin windows 
	to make them float on top of the Mixer could get tedious 
	when there're lots of them.

	The script doesn't differentiate between plugin and other
	type of windows therefore all windows receive priority
	over the Mixer window.

	When track label slot is activated for keyboard input the 
	Mixer window isn't pushed to the background. The track label
	slot can be deactivated and Mixer window sent to the background
	with double click on another MCP, by bringing another window 
	into focus with mouse click or by pressing Enter key.

	Once launched the script runs in the background. To terminate
	it launch it again.
