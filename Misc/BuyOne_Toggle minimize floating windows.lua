ReaScript name: BuyOne_Toggle minimize floating windows.lua
Author: BuyOne
Website: https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=134058 or https://github.com/Buy-One/REAPER-scripts/issues
Version: 1.0
Changelog: #Initial release
Licence: WTFPL
REAPER: at least v5.962
Extensions: SWS/S&M
Screenshot: https://github.com/Buy-One/screenshots/blob/main/Toggle%20minimize%20floating%20windows.mp4
About:	When the script is first applied to a floating window, the window 
			gets minimized and placed at the bottom of the REAPER main window.
			When it's applied to the window which was minimized by it, the
			window original size and location on the screen are restored.
			
			Minimized windows line up in a row from left to right at the 
			bottom of the REAPER main window. When one minimized window is 
			maximized the gap which has been left in the row is filled up 
			by following minimized windows to. 
			They can be moved around freely, this will not affect the ability
			to restore their original properties.

			The minimized windows can be closed manually without restoring
			their orginal size and location. As long as the size and coordinates
			haven't been restored by the script they are kept in the project 
			during the session (and after quitting REAPER, provided the project 
			was saved), can be recalled later and a gap which is left in the 
			minimized windows row isn't filled up by the following windows,
			so when re-opened, it will occupy the same screen space it occupied 
			before closure. So if you wish to avoid creation of gaps in the 
			minimized windows row as a result of window closing, before closing
			toggle it back to its original properies with the script.  
			Once a minimized window original properties have been restored by 
			the script (even if it was resized manually after being minimized) 
			its data are cleared.  
			When a window from the middle or the very beginning of the minimized 
			windows row is restored, the minimized windows to its right will 
			shift leftward to close the gap left by it. Such shift will work as 
			long as such minimized windows weren't closed and then re-opened or,
			if they were closed, their name hasn't changed.
			
			The script can be executed either with a shortcut, with a click
			on a toolbar button, on the 'Run' button in the Action list window
			or by direct double click on the script entry in the Action list.
			Still execution with a shortcut is the most reliable.

			Regardless of the execution method the target window must be first
			brought into focus with a mouse click, so that its top bar becomes
			highlighted.
			
			A shortcut the script is bound to must be applied with the scope
			being 'Global+text fields' which will ensure that REAPER main
			window receives keyboard input even when it's not in focus because
			the target window is in focus at that moment.
			
			If the script is executed with a shortcut while these windows are 
			in focus, it will still target the window which was focused before 
			the focus was moved to these windows.
			
			It's advised to save the project after every script execution so
			that windows properties are stored in the project data and can be 
			recalled in the next project session. For this purpose execute 
			the script from within a custom action 
			
			Custom: Toggle minimize floating windows and save the project
				BuyOne_Toggle minimize floating windows.lua
				File: Save project
						
			
			BATCH ACTIONS
			
			When project tabs are switched back and forth, minimized FX chain
			window width and floating FX windows width and height will be reset
			to their original size. To restore their minimized size arm the script
			(which is convenient to do by right-clicking a toolbar button linked
			to the script) and follow the dialogue options.  
			The same technique can be applied for batch restoration of windows 
			initial minimized coordinates and size after they have been moved 
			elsewhere on the screen or for batch restoration of their original 
			coordinates and size, including after project load. Restoration of
			minimized window properties after REAPER launch under the project 
			they were stored in may not always succeed 100% because that depends 
			on whether the window is open which isn't the case with such windows 
			as Routing or track/take Envelope Manager windows because these don't 
			auto-reopen when REAPER is started.
						
	
			LIMITATIONS
			
			The script can be run only from a toolbar which has 'toolbar' word 
			in its title (regardless of the characters register). Otherwise it 
			will target the very toolbar window it's being executed from.
			
			Docked, toolbar windows (unless their name doesn't include 'toolbar'
			word in it regardless of the characters register) and 'Actions' 
			window aren't supported. If these windows happen to be in focus
			when the script is run with a shortcut, a first supported window 
			located below them in the Z order will be minimized instead.
			'Routing' window minimization isn't supported when MINIMIZE_FULLY 
			user setting is enabled.
			
			If the target window is modal, i.e. blocks access to other UI 
			elements, the script cannot be executed because keyboard input won't 
			be sent to REAPER main window and a toolbar, or a menu, or the 
			interface won't be accessible for the mouse click to execute 
			the script by other means.	
			
			Pinned windows (with the pressed pin in their title bar) cannot
			be minimized.
			
			It's not recommended to change names of takes if any windows 
			associated with them (such as FX chain, floating FX, Envelope Manager 
			windows) are minimized, or close such minimized windows after take 
			name was changed because this decreases the chances of being able to 
			restore their original properties. If this happens you will have to 
			restore such windows manually.
			
			If a minimized FX chain window is closed, when reopened by clicking 
			the TCP or take FX button, its original non-minimized dimensions get 
			restored while its minimized position is maintained so its original 
			position on the screen can still be restored with the script.
			
			Floating window of a bridged 32 bit plugin on a 64 bit system 
			cannot be minimized unless the option 'Run as -> Embed bridged UI' 
			is enabled for it, which is accessible via the plugin entry right 
			click context menu in the FX browser. If not enabled, when such
			window is in focus the script cannot be executed regardless of
			the method probably because it's not related to REAPER main window.
			
			The script was developed and only tested on Windows.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Enable by inserting any alphanumeric character
-- between the quotes to have windows minimized down
-- to their title bar as if they were displayed in a taskbar,
-- this leaves more screen space but has some drawbacks:
-- 1. if REAPER program window is minimized and then
-- maximized again the minimized windows will automatically
-- restore their default minimal dimensions,
-- to prevent that, instead of minimizing REAPER main window
-- to access windows of other applications, activate their
-- windows directly, for example by clicking their tabs in
-- the taskbar; this however won't work if you need access
-- to the desktop since there's no way around minimizing windows,
-- windows also won't keep their fully minimized state when
-- the project is just opened;
-- 2. to restore original properties of a fully minimized window,
-- in the pop-up menu which appears when its title bar is clicked,
-- click 'Restore' option, which will restore the minimized window
-- to its default minimal dimensions and coordinates, after which
-- its original properties can be restored with the script;
-- 3. a fully minimized window which has been closed loses
-- its fully minimized dimensions and on reopening will be restored
-- to its default minimal dimensions, so to recall its fully
-- minimized state arm the script, click on the Arrange canvas
-- and select appropriate options in the prompt dialogue;
-- 4. if a fully minimized window was dragged manually
-- to another location on the screen, next time it's fully
-- minimized it will be placed at the same screen coordinates
-- rather than at the bottom of the REAPER main window next
-- to other minimized windows or, if there's none, at the
-- bottom left hand corner like a minimized window would
-- as per the script design
