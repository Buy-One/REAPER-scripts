About:	The script is part of the Transcribing A workflow set of scripts
	alongside  
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Real time preview.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Format converter.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Import SRT or VTT file as markers and SWS track Notes.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Prepare transcript for rendering.lua   
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Select Notes track based on marker at edit cursor.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Go to segment marker.lua
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Generate Transcribing A toolbar ReaperMenu file.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Offset position of markers in time selection by specified amount.lua

	This is the main script of the set geared towards segment 
	manipulation: creation, boundaries change, split, merger.
	
	
	THE MEDIA ITEM WHOSE CONTENT NEEDS TO BE TRANSCRIBED MUST 
	BE LOCATED AT THE VERY PROJECT START FOR THE SEGMENT TIME STAMPS 
	TO BE ACCURATE BECAUSE TIME IS COUNTED FROM THE PROJECT START
	RATHER THAN FROM THE MEDIA ITEM START.  
	PROJECT TIME BASE MUST BE SET TO TIME SO THAT MEDIA ITEM
	LENGTH AND LOCATION AND MARKERS LOCATION ARE INDEPENDENT 
	OF PROJECT TEMPO.  
	For a method of updating segment time stamps when there's a  
	need to move the media item on the time line after segments 
	have been created, refer to ADDITIONAL WORKFLOW AIDS 
	paragraph below.
	
	
	If your aim is to transcribe for SRT/VTT formats be aware that
	their support by this set of scripts is very basic. When the
	transcript is converted into these formats with the script
	'BuyOne_Transcribing A - Format converter.lua' all textual 
	data which follow the time stamps are moved to the next line, 
	regardless of their nature as if all of them were meant to be 
	displayed on the screen. For VTT format, data between segment
	lines can be retained at conversion which is useful for keeping
	comments, region metadata etc., if any, but garbage as well 
	because the conversion script doesn't analyze such data.  

	The transcription is meant to be managed in the SWS Track notes.
	Between segment lines, which include the time code and the segment 
	transcript, it may contain other content. Whether such other 
	content is retained depends on the export format of 
	'BuyOne_Transcribing A - Format converter.lua' script, 
	however it's discarded entirely by the script 
	'BuyOne_Transcribing A - Prepare transcript for rendering.lua'.
	
	
	► OPERATIONS PEFRORMED BY THE SCRIPT 

	● A. Segment creation
	
	1. Manually set loop points over the audio segment to be transcribed.  
	2. Run the script to add segment time stamp(s) to the Notes of the 
	Notes track, whose name specified in NOTES_TRACK_NAME setting.
	To see the added notes keep the Notes track selected and SWS Notes
	window open with Track notes section active.  
	3. Tanscribe opposite of the time stamp(s) in the Notes window.
			
	The script also inserts project markers with time stamp in the name
	at loop points so the user can go back to previous segments and 
	modify their properties such as bounds. If there's already a segment
	marker at a loop point, new marker will not be inserted. A 'segment
	marker' is a marker with time stamp in its name in the format supported
	by the script.
	
	The transcribing project will include several Notes tracks if the 
	transcript length exceeds the set limit per track. Such tracks are 
	added automatically by the script as necessary.  
	These tracks all bear the name specified in the NOTES_TRACK_NAME 
	setting prefixed by sequential numbers. See more details further
	below.
	
	To create next segment, the following custom action may be used
	(included with the script set in the file 
	'Transcribing workflow custom actions.ReaperKeyMap' )  
	while the loop points are set to the previous segment bounds:
	
	Custom: Transcribing - Shift loop right by the loop length (loop points must already exist)  
	  Time selection: Copy loop points to time selection  
	  Time selection: Shift right (by time selection length)  
	  Time selection: Copy time selection to loop points  
	  Time selection: Remove (unselect) time selection  
	  
	then manually adjust loop start/end points as needed and run 
	the script again, and so on.
	
	Watch demo 'Transcribing A - 1. Segment creation.mp4' which comes 
	with the set of scripts

	
	● B. Segment bounds adjustment
	
	Position of segment markers created previously can be changed, 
	in which case to have the relevant time stamps updated in the 
	marker names and in the Notes entries, after manually changing 
	marker position(s) perform the following sequence:
	
	1. Place the edit cursor within the segment bounds and run 
	the following custom action (included with the script set 
	in the file 'Transcribing workflow custom actions.ReaperKeyMap' )
	
	Custom: Transcribing - Create loop points between adjacent project markers (place edit cursor between markers or at the left one)  
	  Time selection: Remove (unselect) time selection and loop points  
	  View: Move cursor right 8 pixels  
	  Markers: Go to previous marker/project start  
	  Loop points: Set start point  
	  Markers: Go to next marker/project end  
	  Loop points: Set end point  
	  Markers: Go to previous marker/project start
	  
	OR
	
	Double click the Ruler between two adjacent markers 
	to create loop points between them (default double-click mouse 
	modifier action of the Ruler context).
	
	2. Run this script.
	
	Watch demo 'Transcribing A - 2. Segment bounds adjustment.mp4' 
	which comes with the set of scripts.
	
	The operation is also allowed within gaps between segments where
	the loop points is set to markers delimiting the gap between segments
	rather than to those delimiting the adjacent segments.
	
	
	● C. Adding segment within an existing one
	
	New segments can be delimited with project markers within 
	existing ones for this:
	
	1. Manually set loop points between two ADJACENT segment markers
	so that no loop point coincides with such segment markers, otherwise
	'Segment bounds adjustment' operation will be activated.
	2. Run this script.
	
	As a result of the operation two new segment entries will be added
	to the track Notes following the one whose start time stamp matches
	that of the marker immediately preceding the loop start point. If 
	one of these new segments turns out to be redundant because there's 
	no content to transcribe within its bounds its entry can be safely 
	deleted from the Notes.
	
	The script doesn't allow creating new segments when loop points
	are set across existing segments.
	
	Watch demo 'Transcribing A - 3. Adding segment within an existing one.mp4' 
	which comes with the set of scripts.
	
	The operation is also allowed within gaps between segments.

	
	● D. Splitting segments
	
	Existing segments can be split, for this purpose:
	
	1. Run the custom action from step 1 of par. B. above. 	
	2. Manually adjust either start or end point of the loop moving it 
	right or left respectively (the stationary loop point must remain 
	coinciding with one of the existing segment markers, because if both 
	loop points are located within the segment, two new segments will be 
	created as per par. C above instead of the current one being split 
	which only results in creation of one new segment).  
	3. Run this script.

	Watch demo 'Transcribing A - 4. Splitting segments.mp4' which comes 
	with the set of scripts.
	
	The operation isn't allowed within gaps between segments.

	
	● E. Merging segments
	
	Existing segments can be merged, for this purpose manually delete 
	segment markers. IF THERE'S GAP BETWEEN TWO SEGMENTS, TO MERGE THEM 
	THE END MARKER OF THE FIRST AND THE START MARKER OF THE SECOND WILL 
	HAVE TO BE DELETED. If there's no gap only the segment marker 
	separating the two will need to be deleted.   
	Once deleted do the following:
	
	1. Run the custom action from step 1 of par. B. above.  
	2. Run this script.
	
	The deleted segments transcript (if any) will be merged into the Notes 
	entry of the segment which starts at the segment marker immediately
	preceding the first of the deleted segment markers.  
	Any non-segment data which precedes the segments being merged will be 
	deleted unless it's a segment into which others are merged.

	
	When several segment markers are deleted from the end or from the start
	such that as a result another segment marker becomes the last or the first
	the segments for which the deleted markers function as start points 
	get deleted from the Notes.  
	This is different from merging segments because in that case there's no 
	change in the first/last marker.
	
	Watch demo 'Transcribing A - 5. Merging segments.mp4' which comes with 
	the set of scripts
	

	● F. Batch segment update
	
	Normally it's recommended to run the script after each segment marker
	properties or segment marker count change to update the segment data 
	in the track Notes.  
	If however for any reason you failed to update the Notes after several 
	segment marker changes or you wish to update the Notes with several
	changes at once, it's possible to batch update the Notes. 
	For this:  
	
	1. Clear loop points.  
	(native action 'Loop points: Remove (unselect) loop point selection'), 
	2. Run this script and assent to the prompt which will pop up.
	
	Batch segment update function carries out in one go the following
	operations:  
	1. Segment marker and segment Notes entries time stamp update.  
	2. Segment transcript merger in the track Notes.  
	3. Removal of segment markers not associated with any segment entry.
	4. Marker array update if it was reduced by deletion of markers from
	the start and/or from the end, in which case the track Notes will
	be truncated by as many segment entries as the number of segment
	start markers deleted from the start/end of the marker array.
	5. Adding/removing end time stamp from segment entries depending
	on the INCLUDE_END_TIME setting.
	
	Be aware that while the script runs in this mode REAPER may freeze.
	
	
	● G. Deleting segments
	
	1. One way is to merge segment you wish to delete with the preceding
	or the following segment using technique described in par. E above.
	After such merger delete the segment transcript from the segment entry
	it's been merged with in the track Notes.
	
	2. Another way is to first delete segment entries from the Notes and 
	then run the script in Batch segment update mode described in par. F 
	above to delete markers which are uniquely associated with the deleted
	segments and are now redundant.
	
	3. To delete segments from the very start or the very end of the 
	transcript which will result in the change of the first/last
	marker, either the method 2 must be employed or alternatively markers 
	can be deleted first and their deletion followed by running the 
	script in the Batch segment update mode.
	
	
	● E. Settings management and displaying this text
	
	The user can manage the script settings, save for NOTES_TRACK_NAME
	setting, from a menu which will be dislplayed if any of the Notes
	tracks, i.e. those named according to the NOTES_TRACK_NAME setting
	preceded by a numeral, is record armed. The settings can be toggled
	from the menu by typing the first character of the menu item title
	with the exception of 'Save project every script run' which can be
	triggered with keyboard key 'p'.  
	The menu includes 'Help' item a click on which or typing character 
	'v' will call the ReaScript console with this text for reference 
	if needed.
	
	------------------------------------------
	
	► RULES OF THUMB
	
	1. When there're no markers at loop points, they're created and a new 
	Notes entry is added.  
	2. When there're segment markers at loop points, either their time stamps 
	are updated if different from their actual positions OR sequential entries 
	with no matching segment markers are deleted from the Notes and text 
	associated with them (transcript) is merged with the entry immediately 
	preceding the orphan entries which all amounts to operation of segment 
	merging.  
	3. When there's a marker at one loop point only, new marker is created 
	at the non-enganged loop point and a new Note entry is added.
	
	-----------------------------------------
	
	A valid segment is always delimited by 2 markers indicating its
	beginning and end.  
	The very last marker is never associated with a segment start. If 
	INCLUDE_END_TIME setting is enabled its time stamp may appear as a 
	segment end, likewise the first marker is never associated with a 
	segment end.
	
	
	► NOTES SIZE LIMIT
	
	As already mentioned above, there's limit to the SWS Notes. SWS Notes 
	native limit per object is 65,535 bytes, therefore the entire transcript 
	may not fit within a single track Notes.  
	In the script however the limit has been set to 16,383 bytes to make 
	running into the Notes limit within one track less likely in cases where 
	segments are created first and only then the transcript is added to them, 
	because if segment time stamp data hit the Notes native limit of 65,535 
	bytes no further text will be allowed to be added to the Notes and the 
	actual segments transcript will be impossible to add.  
	When in a single track the transcript exceeds 16,383 bytes, additional
	track is automatically created with the name defined in NOTES_TRACK_NAME 
	setting preceded with an ordinal number, i.e. the very first track 
	will be numbered 1 and for each additional track the last number will
	be incremented by 1.	
	
	
	► NEW LINE TAG
	
	The trascript supports new line tag <n> to effect creation of a new
	line for the text which follows the tag during transcript preview 
	within video context with the script
	'BuyOne_Transcribing A - Real time preview.lua'.
	and during its conversion into SRT format with the script 
	'BuyOne_Transcribing A - Import SRT or VTT file as markers and Notes.lua'
	the tag is supported for SRT and VTT output formats. During conversion 
	into AS IS format the tag will be deleted if present. The tag can be 
	preceded and followed by spaces which will be trimmed at conversion.
	
	
	► SAVING
	
	Don't forget to save the project often since SWS Notes are stored
	inside the project file. 
	While hitting save shortcut make sure that REAPER program window 
	is the last clicked, because if the Notes window is the last clicked
	it will intercept the shortcut and saving won't be performed.
	
	BE AWARE THAT SWS NOTES CHANGES WHICH IMMEDIATELY PRECEDE OR FOLLOW 
	REAPER STATE CHANGE WILL GET UNDONE IF SUCH REAPER STATE CHANGE IS 
	UNDONE.  
	This has been reported to the SWS team  
	https://github.com/reaper-oss/sws/issues/1880  
	https://github.com/reaper-oss/sws/issues/1812  
	https://github.com/reaper-oss/sws/issues/1743  
	THEREFORE SAVING OFTEN IS SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT BEACAUSE IT WILL
	ALLOW RESTORATION OF NOTES CHANGES LOST AFTER UNDO BY MEANS OF PROJECT 
	RELOAD. ALTERNATIVELY, IF PREVIOUS STATE CAN BE RESTORED WITHOUT 
	RESORTING TO UNDO IT'S ADVISED TO OPT FOR THIS METHOD. 
	
	To ensure saving you can enable SAVE_PROJECT_EVERY_SCRIPT_RUN 
	setting in this script or use the script as part of the following
	custiom action:
	
	Custom: BuyOne_Transcribing - Create and manage segments + Save  
	 BuyOne_Transcribing A - Create and manage segments.lua  
	 File: Save project
	

	► ADDITIONAL WORKFLOW AIDS
	
	Disable 'Snap to grid' to be able to mark out a segment with 
	loop points with greater precision. Or hold Ctrl/Cmd when
	creating loop points to temporarily disable snapping.
	
	When creating/managing multiple segments back to back it's very 
	convenient to set this script armed by right clicking the 
	toolbar button it's linked to and simply click on the Arrange 
	canvas to run the script.			
  
	To jump to a segment marker
	
	A. Either use the native functionality:  
	
	1. Select segment start/end time stamp in the Notes (can be 
	double clicked) and copy it
	2. Double click the Transport or run Ctrl+J shortcut (default)  
	3. Paste the copied time stamp into the dialogue field  
	4. Click OK or hit Enter  
	
	OR
	
	B. Use the script 'BuyOne_Transcribing A - Go to segment marker.lua'
	included in this set of scripts.  
	If the script is followed by the custom action from par. B above
	namely 'Create loop points between adjacent project markers' within
	another custom action, then in addition to jumping to marker, loop 
	points can be set to the relevant segment.
	
	C. (Less convenient)
	
	1. Have the Ruler time unit set to Minutes:Seconds  
	2. Copy the time stamp from the segment data  
	3. Open the Region/Marker manager  
	4. Make sure the manager setting 'Seek playback when selecting a marker or region'
		is enabled  
	5. Paste the time stamp into the filter field of the manager
	6. Click the marker entry in the manager		
	
	
	To focus on auditioning a segment:  
	
	1. Enable the following actions:  
	Transport: Toggle stop playback at end of loop if repeat is disabled (available since build 4.30)  
	OR  
	Xenakios/SWS: [Deprecated] Toggle stop playback at end of loop  
	2. Set loop points to the segment using the custom action from step 1 of par. B above.  
	3. Hit Play to audition, at the end of the loop the play cursor will  
	return to the original position  

	To stop playback in the middle of the segment use  
	
	EITHER  
	Transport: Play/pause  
	OR  
	Transport: Pause	
	
	
	To navigate between segments for auditioning or preview
	within video context with 'BuyOne_Transcribing A - Real time preview.lua' 
	script when the transport is stopped use the following custom 
	actions (included with the script set in the file 
	'Transcribing workflow custom actions.ReaperKeyMap' ):
	
	Custom: Transcribing - Move loop points to next segment (loop points must already be set)  
	  Time selection: Remove (unselect) time selection  
	  Go to start of loop  
	  Markers: Go to next marker/project end  
	  Loop points: Set start point  
	  Markers: Go to next marker/project end  
	  Loop points: Set end point  
	  Go to start of loop

	Custom: Transcribing - Move loop points to previous segment (loop points must already be set)  
	  Time selection: Remove (unselect) time selection  
	  Go to start of loop  
	  Markers: Go to previous marker/project start  
	  Loop points: Set start point  
	  Markers: Go to next marker/project end  
	  Loop points: Set end point  
	  Go to start of loop

	  
	If after you started your project you need to move the transcript
	media source later or earlier (after trimming from the beginning)
	on the time line in order to lengthen/shorten the time between the 
	media start and the transcribed content start within the media 
	(remember, that transcript segments time stamp will only be 
	accurate if the media starts at and is rendered from the project 
	start) you can:
	
	A. 
	1. Enable 'Ripple edit all tracks'.  
	2. Ensure that the media item spans all segment markers otherwise 
	the feature won't work.  
	3. Change the position of the media item by dragging it and the 
	markers will follow.
	
	B. After moving the media item take advantage of the script  
	'BuyOne_Transcribing A - Offset position of markers in time selection by specified amount.lua'
	included in the script set.  
	
	In both cases after marker positions have been changed run this 
	script in Batch segment update mode (see par. F above) in order 
	to update segment time stamps in the marker names and in track Notes.

	
	► CONVERSION BETWEEN PROJECTS
	
	To convert between Transcribing A and B workflow projects export 
	the source project as an SRT or VTT file and import it back into 
	REAPER using the scripts  
	'BuyOne_Transcribing A - Format converter.lua' to export and
	'BuyOne_Transcribing B - Import SRT or VTT file as regions.lua'
	to import, or vice versa  
	'BuyOne_Transcribing B - Format converter.lua'
	'BuyOne_Transcribing A - Import SRT or VTT file as regions.lua'
	depending on the direction of conversion.	 
	If transcript of Transcribing A workflow source project contains 
	metadata meant to be exported in VTT format, it will be lost as 
	a result of import with 
	'BuyOne_Transcribing B - Import SRT or VTT file as regions.lua'
	script because Transcribing B workflow doesn't support metadata.
	
	
	►  CAVEATS
	
	When track Notes which due to their length cannot fit within the 
	current Notes window, are getting updated with the script, the 
	Notes window scroll position is reset to the top of the window. 
	So one has to scroll down to search for the target line again 
	in the Notes if it's located outside of the visible area. However 
	this is fixable by installing js_ReaScriptAPI extension from     
	https://github.com/juliansader/ReaExtensions  
	or via ReaPack.
	
	The track specific scroll position is also not stored, so when 
	the Notes window is switched between tracks by changing track 
	selection the Notes window scroll position will each time end up 
	being reset to the top. This can't be fixed because these actions
	are performed independently of the script.
