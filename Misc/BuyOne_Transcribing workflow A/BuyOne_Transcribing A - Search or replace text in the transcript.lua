About:	The script is part of the Transcribing A workflow set of scripts
	alongside  
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Create and manage segments (MAIN).lua   
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Real time preview.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Format converter.lua

	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Offset position of markers in time selection by specified amount.lua
	
	Meant to search transcript created with the script  
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Create and manage segments (MAIN).lua
	or replace text in it.
	
	► SEARCH
	
	The search starts from the first selected track whose Notes 
	contain the transcript, if there're several such tracks.
	If no track is selected or no transcript track is selected
	the search starts from the 1st track whose Notes contain 
	the transcript if there're several such tracks.  
	Within the transcript the search starts from the line where 
	the cursor (caret) was located most recently and if the 
	search term was found and the search continues it will resume
	from the location on the line immediately following the found 
	match. Running search in headless mode (see below) allows 
	retreating or advancing search within the Notes window by 
	clicking above or below the line of the latest search match.  
	If the SWS Notes window isn't open before the script is executed
	the script will open it and in this case the search will start 
	from the 1st line of the transcript displayed in the opened 
	Notes window.  			
	Once a search match is found the search dialogue is reloaded 
	with fields already filled out with the last search settings. 
	To continue the search press OK button.  
	The search is curcular, after parsing the transcript part stored
	in the notes of last Notes track it loops around to the 1st
	Notes track.
	
	In order to enable the search settings 'Match case' and
	'Match exact word' insert any character in the corresponding
	field.			
	
	The Notes window is scrolled towards the line containing the 
	search match if there's enough scrolling space. The match itself 
	is also highlighted within the line, however due to the fact that 
	the search dialogue is a modal window it assumes absolute focus 
	as long as it's open therefore the text highlighting inside the 
	Notes window isn't visible.  
	To overcome this shortcoming a headless search mode has been devised.
	To use it:  
	1. Arm the script. For example from the 'Transcribing A' toolbar button
	(see script BuyOne_Transcribing A - Generate Transcribing A toolbar ReaperMenu file.lua)  
	Arming must be done before running the script because being modal
	search dialogue will prevent interaction with other windows as long
	as it stays open.  
	2. Run it by clicking anywhere over the Arrange view canvas as long
	as the letter 'A' is displayed next to the mouse cursor signifying
	script's armed state.  
	2A If this is the first search during session in which case there're
	no search settings in the buffer, the search dialogue will pop up.
		I. When it does, fill out search settings and click OK.  
		II. Continue the search with the latest search setting by clicking on 
		the Arrange view canvas. The dialogue won't be reloaded because of 
		the script's armed state.  
	2B If the latest search settings have already been stored in the buffer
	which they have if the search was excuted at least once, the seatch will 
	continue.  
	3. To access the search dialogue again unarm the script and run it 
	as normal. 
	
	SWS/S&M extension provides Find utility which also allows searching 
	track notes however it doesn't make the Notes window scroll to bring 
	the search match into view nor does it highlight the found match. 
	It's also only does non-circular search.
	
	If the REAPER build you're using is older than 7.03, then running 
	search with this script you're likely to encounter 'ReaScript task control' 
	dialogue pop up. Once it does, checkmark 'Remember my answer for 
	this script' checkbox and press 'New instance' button, this will 
	prevent the pop up from appearing in the future.
	
	► REPLACEMENT
	
	There're 3 replacement modes: 
	0 - batch replacement in the Notes of all tracks containing the transcript, 
	which can be several if the transcript exceeds 65,535 bytes.  
	1 - batch replacement in the only or the first selected track containing 
	the transcript  
	2 - replacement word by word
	
	To activate a mode, type a digit which represents it above in the 
	'Enable replacement' field of the search dialogue.  
	All other fields relevant to search are also relevant to replacement.
	
	When track notes displayed in the Notes window are updated in modes 0 and 1, 
	the window scroll position is reset, therefore it's advised to have
	js_ReaScriptAPI extension installed which will allow restoration of the
	Notes window scroll position in such cases.

	Since modes 0 and 1 could be resource intensive REAPER may freeze
	for a number of seconds while the replacements are being made.
	
	The 'Enable replacement' setting is not stored between script launches 
	for safety reasons to prevent inadvertent replacement, even though the 
	rest of the settings are kept.
	
	Of course replacements in the transctipt can also be made outside 
	of REAPER and the SWS Notes window with any 3d party software.
