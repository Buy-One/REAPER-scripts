ReaScript name: BuyOne_Transcribing A - Select Notes track based on marker at edit cursor.lua
Author: BuyOne
Website: https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=134058 or https://github.com/Buy-One/REAPER-scripts/issues
Version: 1.5
Changelog: 1.5 	#Fixed text highlighting if HIGHLIGHT_SEGMENT_ENTRY setting 
	       	is enabled in cases where track Notes contain Unicode characters  
	   1.4 	#Fixed track notes evaluation within the Notes window for SWS builds 
	       	where BR_Win32_GetWindowText() function's buffer size is 1 kb 
	   1.3 	#Added HIGHLIGHT_SEGMENT_ENTRY settings
	   1.2 	#Added scrolling of the Notes window to the line contaning 
	       	the time stamp of the marker at the edit cursor
		#Improved accuracy of the error message when there's 
	 	no segment marker at the edit or play cursor
	 	#Improved detection of Notes track absence
		#Updated script name
	    1.1 #Added character escaping to NOTES_TRACK_NAME setting evaluation 
		to prevent errors caused unascaped characters
Licence: WTFPL
REAPER: at least v5.962
Extensions: SWS/S&M mandatory, js_ReaScriptAPI recommended
About:	The script is part of the Transcribing A workflow set of scripts
	alongside  
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Create and manage segments (MAIN).lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Real time preview.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Format converter.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Import SRT or VTT file as markers and SWS track Notes.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Prepare transcript for rendering.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Go to segment marker.lua
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Generate Transcribing A toolbar ReaperMenu file.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Offset position of markers in time selection by specified amount.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing A - Search or replace text in the transcript.lua
	
	It's a kind of the opposite of the script  
	'BuyOne_Transcribing A - Go to segment marker.lua'
	
	Since the transcript can be divided between several tracks
	due to SWS Notes size limit per object, this script allows
	selecting the Notes track in which the time stamp of the
	marker closest to the edit cursor on the left or currently 
	at the edit cursor is found which simplifies the workflow.
	When there's enough scrolling space the Notes window will 
	be scrolled to the line which contains the time stamp 
	matching the marker at the cursor.
	
	When REAPER is in play mode the reference position is taken
	from the play cursor, otherwise from the edit cursor.
	
	If you find it more convenient to point at a marker or a space
	between them with the mouse cursor, the following custom action
	can be used being mapped to a shortcut:
	
	Custom: Transcribing - Select Notes track based on marker at edit cursor  
		View: Move edit cursor to mouse cursor  
		BuyOne_Transcribing A - Select Notes track based on marker at edit cursor.lua
		
	
	If the Notes window is closed the script will open it.
		
	The script doesn't create an undo point.

-- Between the quotes insert the name of track(s)
