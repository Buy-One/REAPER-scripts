ReaScript name: BuyOne_Transcribing B - Real time preview.lua
Author: BuyOne
Website: https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=134058 or https://github.com/Buy-One/REAPER-scripts/issues
Version: 1.0
Changelog: #Initial release
Licence: WTFPL
REAPER: at least v6.37
About:	The script is part of the Transcribing B workflow set of scripts
	alongside  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Create and manage segments (MAIN).lua
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Format converter.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Import SRT or VTT file as regions.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Prepare transcript for rendering.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Generate Transcribing B toolbar ReaperMenu file.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Show entry of region selected or at cursor in Region-Marker Manager.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Offset position of regions in time selection by specified amount.lua
	
	meant to display the transcript segment by segment in real time
	while REAPER is in play mode or when the edit cursor is located
	within segment regions.			

	The transcript is retrieved from the segment region names which 
	are defined by the SEGMENT_REGION_COLOR setting of the USER SETTINGS 
	and is displayed in the Video window segment by segment through 
	empty items which have an instance of the Video processor plugin 
	inserted in their FX chain with the preset defined in the OVERLAY_PRESET 
	setting. The segment transcript is fed into the preview item names.
	
	To have text displayed within the Video window the location of the 
	preview track relative to the track with the video item must follow 
	the 'Video item visibility' setting at Project settings -> Video tab.
	The preview items are added dynamically to accommodate segment
	next to the currently active segment which is determined by the 
	location of the edit or play cursor relative to the segment region. 
	Therefore while the transport is in play mode, in order to insert 
	a preview item for a particular segment without waiting until it'll 
	be added in the course of the playback, move the edit cursor to the 
	location immediately preceding the segment region.  
	This mechanism has been devised to overcome Video processor 
	limitation which prevents it from processing changes in track/take 
	names as soon as the change occurs so it must be allowed to process
	the content in advance.  
	If everything functions properly, during playback there should be no 
	more than 2 preview items on the prevew track at any given moment, 
	one for the current and another for the next segment. There'll be 
	only 1 when the last segment is being played and when the cursor is 
	located to the left of the very	first segment region.  
	When the transport is stopped, in order to have a preview item 
	created for a particular segment place the edit cursor directly 
	within the bounds (start and before the end) of the relevant segment 
	region. In this scenario it's possible to prevew the transcript within 
	video context simply by repeatedly running the custom actions 
	'Custom: Transcribing - Move loop points to next/previous segment'
	(included with the script set 
	in the file 'Transcribing workflow custom actions.ReaperKeyMap' )
	for instance by clicking the buttons linked to them on the 
	'Transcribing B toolbar' whose ReaperMenu file can be generated
	with  
	'BuyOne_Transcribing B - Generate Transcribing B toolbar ReaperMenu file.lua'
	script.
	
	For non-segment regions, i.e. regions whose color differs from 
	the one defined in the SEGMENT_REGION_COLOR setting, and segment 
	regions with no transcript preview items are not created.
	
	The script must run in the background which it will after the 
	initial launch. To terminate it, launch it again and click 
	'Terminate instances' button in the ReaScript task control dialogue 
	which will pop up. Before doing this it's recommended to checkmark 
	'Remember my answer for this script option' so from then on the 
	script is terminated automatically.
	
	While the script runs a toolbar button linked to it is lit and 
	a menu item is ticked.
	
	The script only works under the project tab it's originally been
	launched under. To use it in another project tab terminate it 
	and re-launch under it.  
	
	For preview another script can be used, which is
	'BuyOne_Transcribing B - Prepare transcript for rendering.lua'
	however it's not as flexible as this one, because the preview
	items it creates are static and if segments have been updated 
	it will have to be run again to recreate the static preview items. 
	
	On the other hand this script creates redundant undo points each
	time a new preview item is inserted which cannot be prevented 
	and which increase and lengthen the undo history unnecessarily. 
	So it may be a good idea to use it in a project copy rathen than 
	directly in the main project. 
	
	Watch demo 'Transcribing B - 5. Real time preview.mp4' which comes 
	with the set of scripts
