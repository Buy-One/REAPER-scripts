Author: BuyOne
Website: https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=134058 or https://github.com/Buy-One/REAPER-scripts/issues
Version: 1.1
Changelog:	#Fixed error in one by one replacement mode when segment region name contains 
		several search matches and the replacement term contains the search term				
		#Added a workaround for the issue of unbalanced characters handling by ReaScript API
		#Added error message when the dialogue is submitted with empty 'Replace target:' field 
		#Added error message when search and replacement terms are identical
		#Updated 'About' text
Licence: WTFPL
REAPER: recommended 7.03 and newer
Extensions: SWS/S&M or js_ReaScriptAPI is recommended			
About:	The script is part of the Transcribing B workflow set of scripts
	alongside 
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Create and manage segments (MAIN).lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Real time preview.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Format converter.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Import SRT or VTT file as regions.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Prepare transcript for rendering.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Generate Transcribing B toolbar ReaperMenu file.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Show entry of region selected or at cursor in Region-Marker Manager.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Offset position of regions in time selection by specified amount.lua
	
	Installation of extensions isn't absolutely necessary as the script 
	can do the job without them but they may enhance the user experience
	because they help isolating in the Region/Marker Manager the targeted
	segment region for the sake of visual freedback of the replacement
	result.
	
	In order to enable settings '3. Match case' and '4. Match exact word'
	insert any character in the corresponding field, preferably 
	avoiding apostrophe ', quotation mark " and parentheses ( or ).
	
	As a setting '5. Mode' the script offers 4 replacement modes:  
	0. Batch replace in all segment regions  
	1. Batch replace in segment regions within time selection  
	2. Batch replace in segment regions from the edit/mouse cursor onwards  
	3. Batch replace from the first segment region up to the edit/mouse cursor  
	4. Word by word starting from the segment region at the edit/mouse cursor
	
	In mode 2 time selection may include region start, region end, both
	or be inside the region.  
	In mode 4 replacement starts from the region at the edit cursor which 
	includes the entire region width but not its end marker.  		
	If there's no region at cursor the closest next region will be used 
	as the starting point.  			
	To look up the modes, type character h or H (for help) in the field 
	'5. Mode' of the replacement dialogue.


	► js_ReaScriptAPI extension

	With js_ReaScriptAPI extension in modes 0-3 the script is able to scroll 
	the Region/Marker Manager towards the entry of the first segment region 
	whose name was changed in the range affected by the script and in mode 4 
	towards the entry of the segment region whose name was edited last, UNLESS 
	SUCH ENTRY IS ALREADY WITHIN VIEW. If not within view such entry is scrolled 
	into view either at the bottom or at the top of the Region/Marker Manager list.  
	Unlike with the SWS extension it's not possible to automatically fill out 
	the Region/Marker Manager filter field with he replacement term to isolate 
	entries containing the replacement term so that they're more apparent in
	the list. However the replacement term can be copied from the replacement
	dialogue and pasted in the Region/Marker Manager filter field. In this
	respect there're a couple of guidelines:  
	1. If you search to replace the exact match (field '4. Match exact word' is
	enabled in the dialogue), enclose the replacement term in the Region/Marker 
	Manager filter field within single or double quotes which is the exact match
	operator in REAPER.
	2. Since in REAPER words AND, OR, NOT (in upper case) are used as list filter 
	operators, if the replacement term contains them, in the Region/Marker Manager 
	filter field change their case to lower so that they're interpreted as regular
	words and not as operators. 
	
	If the REAPER build you're using is older than 7.03, then using this script 
	with js_ReaScriptAPI extension and having the replacement term in the 
	Region/Marker Manager filter field you're likely to encounter 'ReaScript task control' 
	dialogue pop up. Once it does, checkmark 'Remember my answer for this script' 
	checkbox and press 'New instance' button, this will prevent the pop up from 
	appearing in the future.
	
	
	► SWS/S&M extension

	With the SWS/S&M extension in modes 0-3 the Region/Marker Manager list 
	is by default filtered with the replacement term and is scrolled towards 
	the entry of the first segment region whose stranscript was changed 
	in the range affected by the script while in mode 4 the entry of the
	segment region whose name was changed last can either be scrolled into
	view or isolated in the list through insertion of either the updated segment
	transcript or the replacement term into the Manager's filter field depending 
	on the USER SETTINGS. When scrolled, such segment region entry is scrolled 
	to the top of the list as long as the list is long enough.  
	In order for scrolling to be accurate Region/Marker Manager display settings
	('Regions', 'Markers', and 'Take markers' checkboxes) are changed so that 
	only regions are listed. The entries in the Region/Marker Manager must be 
	sorted by start in ascending order otherwise the scrolling won't be performed.

	If both extensions are installed js_ReaScriptAPI has priority which can be 
	changed in the USER SETTINGS.	
	
	In replacement mode 4 the edit cursor follows the replacement progress and
	is moved to the segment region whose transcript was edited the last.  
	
	If extensions are installed and the Region/Marker Manager is closed at the
	moment of the script execution, the script will open it so that the user 
	can get visual feedback of the changes to the transcript.
	
	
	CAVEATS
	
	Due to an issue of handling unbalanced (odd numbered) parentheses, apostrophe 
	and quotation marks by the ReaScript API
	(ref: https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=288046)
	for the sake of correct text display within the replacement dialogue the script 
	adds as many instances of these characters as needed (if needed) to balance them 
	out. 
	In the case of unbalanced quotation marks and parentheses the script generates
	a warning message and allows the user to fix the field content after balancing
	them out automatically to be able to maintain the dialogue content integrity
	when it's reloaded after the warning message.  
	In the case of apostrophe an odd number of instances (most common 1) the script 
	converts into an even number, so a single ' becomes '' for the sake of display
	within the dialogue. Internally however all occurrences of multiple apostrophe
	instances the script converts into a single instance as would be required by
	regular syntax. For this reason it won't be possible to add multiple apostrophes
	to the segment transcript via the replacement term (should such a need arise) 
	which along with the requirement to use replace target and replacement terms with
	balanced quotation marks and perentheses is an inevitable side effect of tackling 
	the above mentioned issue.  
	Unbalanced characters in fields 3 and 4, which are optional, are substituted 
	with + sign.
