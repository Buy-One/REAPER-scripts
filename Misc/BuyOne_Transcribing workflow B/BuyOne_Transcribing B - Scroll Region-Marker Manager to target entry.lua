ReaScript name: BuyOne_Transcribing B - Scroll Region-Marker Manager to target entry.lua
Author: BuyOne
Website: https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=134058 or https://github.com/Buy-One/REAPER-scripts/issues
Version: 1.0
Changelog: #Initial release
Licence: WTFPL
REAPER: at least v5.962
Extensions: js_ReaScriptAPI preferable, or SWS/S&M
About:	The script is part of the Transcribing B workflow set of scripts
	alongside  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Create and manage segments (MAIN).lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Real time preview.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Format converter.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Import SRT or VTT file as regions.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Prepare transcript for rendering.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Generate Transcribing B toolbar ReaperMenu file.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing B - Offset position of regions in time selection by specified amount.lua
	
	If js_ReaScriptAPI extension is installed the script either scrolls 
	'Region/Marker Manager' to the entry of region currently selected in Arrange 
	(since REAPER build 7.16). If the build you're using is older or no region 
	is selected the script scrolls to the entry of a region at the edit or mouse 
	(if the setting AT_MOUSE_CURSOR is enabled) cursor provided the region name 
	field isn't empty.  
	If only SWS/S&M extension is installed, REAPER build is immeterial. The script 
	searches for region at the edit or mouse (if the setting AT_MOUSE_CURSOR is 
	enabled) cursor, and if the found region's name isn't empty or if ANCHOR_STRING
	setting is enabled the script places its name into the Manager's filter field 
	thereby isolating its entry in the Manager's list.	
	
	If the Region/Marker Manager is closed the script will open it.
	
	The script was tested on Windows only.
	
	To point at a region place the edit or point the mouse cursor at its start 
	or place within its bounds.	
	
	Another way of targeting a region with the mouse cursor other than by enabling 
	AT_MOUSE_CURSOR setting, is using the following custom action bound to a shortcut:
	
	Custom: Transcribing - Show entry of region at mouse cursor in Region-Marker Manager  
		View: Move edit cursor to mouse cursor  
		BuyOne_Transcribing B - Show entry of region selected or at cursor in Region-Marker Manager.lua

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------ USER SETTINGS --------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- This setting is only needed if you're using the script
-- as part of the transcribing workflow while only having
-- SWS/S&M extension installed, because only in this case
-- the region name will be placed into the Region/Marker
-- Manager filter field to isolate its entry (see 'About:'
-- text in the header) for managing the transcript;
-- While editing segment transcript which is contained in
-- segment region name you'd want the region entry in the
-- Manager to always be visible, however since the region
-- entry is filtered by name, as soon as you apply the edited
-- region name, that is transcript text, the region entry will
-- disappear from the list because it will no longer match
-- the filter search term. To overcome this problem the script
-- will append an anchor string defined by this setting
-- (one character suffices, but there's no limit) to the very
-- start of the transcript text so that even if you edit the
-- transcript text in the region name the region entry will
-- remain visible in the Manager as long as the anchor string
-- is there. Once you've done editing the segment transcript,
-- manually delete this anchor string from its beginning;
-- This setting allows targeting unnamed regions as well;
-- Example anchor string: ยง
ANCHOR_STRING = "ยง"


-- Enable by inserting any alphanumeric character between
-- the quotes to force the script to first search for region
-- at mouse cursor,
-- the mouse cursor must be located within Arrange, i.e.
-- below the ruler, not be blocked by other windows
-- and be opposite of any track TCP;
-- if none of the conditions are met or no region is found
-- at mouse cursor the script it will search
-- for a region at the edit cursor;
