Author: BuyOne
Website: https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=134058 or https://github.com/Buy-One/REAPER-scripts/issues
Version: 1.0
Changelog: #Initial release
Licence: WTFPL
REAPER: at least v6.37
Extensions: SWS/S&M
About:	The script is part of the Transcribing workflow set of scripts
	alongside  
	BuyOne_Transcribing - Real time preview.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing - Format converter.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing - Import SRT or VTT file as markers and SWS track Notes.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing - Prepare transcript for rendering.lua   
	BuyOne_Transcribing - Select Notes track based on marker at edit cursor.lua  
	BuyOne_Transcribing - Go to segment marker.lua
	BuyOne_Transcribing - Generate Transcribing toolbar ReaperMenu file.lua

	This is the main script os the set geared towards segment 
	manipulation: creation, boundaries change, split, merger.
	
	
	THE MEDIA ITEM WHOSE CONTENT NEEDS TO BE TRANSCRIBED MUST 
	BE LOCATED AT THE VERY PROJECT START FOR THE SEGMENT TIME STAMPS 
	TO BE ACCURATE BECAUSE TIME IS COUNTED FROM THE PROJECT START
	RATHER THAN FROM THE VIDEO ITEM START.
	
	If your aim is to transcribe for .SRT/.VTT formats be aware that
	their support by this set of scripts is very basic. When the
	transcript is converted into these formats with the script
	'BuyOne_Transcribing - Format converter.lua' all textual 
	data which follow the time stamps are moved to the next line, 
	regardless of their nature as if all of them where meant to be 
	displayed on the screen. For .VTT format, data between segment
	lines can be retained at conversion which is useful for keeping
	comments, region data etc., if any, but garbage as well because 
	the conversion script doesn't analyze such data.
	
	
	► OPERATIONS PEFRORMED BY THE SCRIPT 

	● A. Segment creation
	
	1. Manually set loop points over the audio segment to be transcribed.  
	2. Run the script to add segment time stamp(s) to the Notes of the 
	Notes track, whose name specified in NOTES_TRACK_NAME setting.
	To see the added notes keep the Notes track selected and SWS Notes
	window open with Track notes section active.  
	3. Tanscribe opposite of the time stamp(s) in the Notes window.
			
	The script also inserts project markers with time stamp in the name
	at loop points so the user can go back to previous segments and 
	modify their properties such as bounds. If there's already a segment
	marker at a loop point, new marker will not be inserted. A 'segment
	marker' is a marker with time stamp in its name in the format supported
	by the script.
	
	The transcribing project will include several Notes tracks if the 
	transcript length exceeds the set limit per track. Such tracks are 
	added automatically by the script as necessary.  
	These tracks all bear the name specified in the NOTES_TRACK_NAME 
	setting prefixed by sequential numbers. See more details further
	below.
	
	To create next segment, the following custom action may be used
	(included with the script set in the file 
	'Transcribing workflow custom actions.ReaperKeyMap' )  
	while the loop points are set to the previous segment bounds:
	
	Custom: Shift loop right by the loop length (loop points must already exist)  
	  Time selection: Copy loop points to time selection  
	  Time selection: Shift right (by time selection length)  
	  Time selection: Copy time selection to loop points  
	  Time selection: Remove (unselect) time selection  
	  
	then manually adjust loop start/end points as needed and run 
	the script again, and so on.
	
	Watch demo '1. Segment creation.mp4' which comes with the 
	set of scripts

	
	● B. Segment bounds adjustment
	
	Position of segment markers created previously can be changed, 
	in which case to have the relevant time stamps updated in the 
	marker names and in the Notes entries, after manually changing 
	marker position(s) perform the following sequence:
	
	1. Place the edit cursor within the segment bounds and run 
	the following custom action (included with the script set 
	in the file 'Transcribing workflow custom actions.ReaperKeyMap' )
	
	Custom: Create loop points between adjacent project markers (place edit cursor between markers or at the left one)  
	  Time selection: Remove (unselect) time selection and loop points  
	  View: Move cursor right 8 pixels  
	  Markers: Go to previous marker/project start  
	  Loop points: Set start point  
	  Markers: Go to next marker/project end  
	  Loop points: Set end point  
	  Markers: Go to previous marker/project start
	  
   OR
  
   Double click the Ruler between two adjacent markers 
   to create loop points between them (default double-click mouse 
   modifier action of the Ruler context).
	
	2. Run this script.
	
	Watch demo '2. Segment bounds adjustment.mp4' which comes with 
	the set of scripts
	
	
	● C. Adding segment within an existing one
	
	New segments can be delimited with project markers within 
	existing ones for this:
	
	1. Manually set loop points between two ADJACENT segment markers
	so that no loop point coincides with such segment markers, otherwise
	'Segment bounds adjustment' operation will be activated.
	2. Run this script.
	
	As a result of the operation two new segment entries will be added
	to the track Notes following the one whose start time stamp matches
	that of the marker immediately preceding the loop start point. If 
	one of these new segments turns out to be redundant because there's 
	no content to transcribe within its bounds its entry can be safely 
	deleted from the Notes.
	
	The script doesn't allow creating new segments when loop points
	are set across existing segments.
	
	Watch demo '3. Adding segment within an existing one.mp4' which 
	comes with the set of scripts

	
	● D. Splitting segments
	
	Existing segments can be split, for this purpose:
	
	1. Run the custom action from step 1 of par. B. above. 	
	2. Manually adjust either start or end point of the loop moving it 
	right or left respectively (the stationary loop point must remain 
	coinciding with one of the existing segment markers, because if both 
	loop points are located within the segment, two new segments will be 
	created as per par. C above instead of the current one being split 
	which only results in creation of one new segment).  
	3. Run this script.

	Watch demo '4. Splitting segments.mp4' which comes with the set 
	of scripts

	
	● E. Merging segments
	
	Existing segments can be merged, for this purpose manually delete 
	segment markers. IF THERE'S GAP BETWEEN TWO SEGMENTS, TO MERGE THEM 
	THE END MARKER OF THE FIRST AND THE START MARKER OF THE SECOND WILL 
	HAVE TO BE DELETED. If there's no gap only the segment marker 
	separating the two will need to be deleted.   
	Once deleted do the following:
	
	1. Run the custom action from step 1 of par. B. above.  
	2. Run this script.
	
	The deleted segments transcript (if any) will be merged into the Notes 
	entry of the segment which starts at the segment marker immediately
	preceding the first of the deleted segment markers.  
	Any non-segment data which precedes the segments being merged will be 
	deleted unless it's a segment into which others are merged.

	
	When several segment markers are deleted from the end or from the start
	such that as a result another segment marker becomes the last or the first
	the segments for which the deleted markers function as start points 
	get deleted from the Notes.  
	This is different from merging segments because in that case there's no 
	change in the first/last marker.
	
	Watch demo '5. Merging segments.mp4' which comes with the set of scripts
	

	● F. Batch segment update
	
	Normally it's recommended to run the script after each segment marker
	properties or segment marker count change to update the segment data 
	in the track Notes.  
	If however for any reason you failed to update the Notes after several 
	segment marker changes, it's possible to batch update the Notes. 
	For this:  
	
	1. Clear loop points.  
	(native action 'Loop points: Remove (unselect) loop point selection'), 
	2. Run this script and assent to the prompt which will pop up.
	
	Batch segment update function carries out in one go the following
	operations in one go:  
	1. Segment marker and segment Notes entries time stamp update.  
	2. Segment transcript merger in the track Notes.  
	3. Marker array update if it was reduced by deletion of markers from
	the start and/or from the end, in which case the track Notes will
	be truncated by as many segment entries as the number of segment
	start markers deleted from the start/end of the marker array.

	------------------------------------------
	
	► RULES OF THUMB
	
	1. When there're no markers at loop points, they're created and a new 
	Notes entry is added.  
	2. When there're segment markers at loop points, either their time stamps 
	are updated if different from their actual positions OR sequential entries 
	with no matching segment markers are deleted from the Notes and text 
	associated with them (transcript) is merged with the entry immediately 
	preceding the orphan entries which all amounts to operation of segment 
	merging.  
	3. When there's a marker at one loop point only, new marker is created 
	at the non-enganged loop point and a new Note entry is added.
	
	-----------------------------------------
	
	A valid segment is always delimited by 2 markers indicating its
	beginning and end.  
	The very last marker is never associated with a segment start. If 
	INCLUDE_END_TIME setting is enabled its time stamp may appear as a 
	segment end, likewise the first marker is never associated with a 
	segment end.
	
	► NOTES SIZE LIMIT
	
	As already mentioned above, there's limit to the SWS Notes. SWS Notes 
	native limit per object is 65,535 bytes, therefore the entire transcript 
	may not fit within a single track Notes.  
	In the script however the limit has been set to 16,383 bytes to make 
	running into the Notes limit within one track less likely in cases where 
	segments are created first and only then the transcript is added to them, 
	because if segment time stamp data hit the Notes native limit of 65,535 
	bytes no further text will be allowed to be added to the Notes and the 
	actual segments transcript will be impossible to add.  
	When in a single track the transcript exceeds 16,383 bytes, additional
	track is automatically created with the name defined in NOTES_TRACK_NAME 
	setting preceded with an ordinal number, i.e. the very first track 
	will be numbered 1 and for each additional track the last number will
	be incremented by 1.	
	
	
	► NEW LINE TAG
	
	The trascript supports new line tag <n> to effect creation of a new
	line for the text which follows the tag during transcript preview 
	within video context with the script
	'BuyOne_Transcribing - Real time preview.lua'.
	and during its conversion into SRT format with the script 
	'BuyOne_Transcribing - Import SRT or VTT file as markers and Notes.lua'
	the tag is supported for SRT and VTT output formats. During conversion 
	into AS IS format the tag will be deleted if present. The tag can be 
	preceded and followed by spaces which will be trimmed at conversion.
	
	
	► SAVING
	
	Don't forget to save the project often since SWS Notes are stored
	inside the project file. 
	While hitting save shortcut make sure that REAPER program window 
	is the last clicked, because if the Notes window is the last clicked
	it will intercept the shortcut and saving won't be performed.
	
	BE AWARE THAT SWS NOTES CHANGES WHICH IMMEDIATELY PRECEDE OR FOLLOW 
	REAPER STATE CHANGE WILL GET UNDONE IF SUCH REAPER STATE CHANGE IS 
	UNDONE.  
	This has been reported to the SWS team  
	https://github.com/reaper-oss/sws/issues/1880  
	https://github.com/reaper-oss/sws/issues/1812  
	https://github.com/reaper-oss/sws/issues/1743  
	THEREFORE SAVING OFTEN IS SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT BEACAUSE IT WILL
	ALLOW RESTORATION OF NOTES CHANGES LOST AFTER UNDO BY MEANS OF PROJECT 
	RELOAD. ALTERNATIVELY, IF PREVIOUS STATE CAN BE RESTORED WITHOUT 
	RESORTING TO UNDO IT'S ADVISED TO OPT FOR THIS METHOD. 
	
	To ensure saving you can enable SAVE_PROJECT_EVERY_SCRIPT_RUN 
	setting in this script or use the script as part of the following
	custiom action:
	
	Custom: BuyOne_Transcribing - Create and manage segments + Save  
	 BuyOne_Transcribing - Create and manage segments.lua  
	 File: Save project
	

	► ADDITIONAL WORKFLOW AIDS
	
	Disable 'Snap to grid' to be able to mark out a segment with 
	loop points with greater precision. Or hold Ctrl/Cmd when
	creating loop points to temporarily disable snapping.
	
	Custom actions (included with the script set in the file 
	'Transcribing workflow custom actions.ReaperKeyMap' )
	
	Custom: Move loop points to next segment (loop points must already be set)  
	  Time selection: Remove (unselect) time selection  
	  Go to start of loop  
	  Markers: Go to next marker/project end  
	  Loop points: Set start point  
	  Markers: Go to next marker/project end  
	  Loop points: Set end point  
	  Go to start of loop

	Custom: Move loop points to previous segment (loop points must already be set)  
	  Time selection: Remove (unselect) time selection  
	  Go to start of loop  
	  Markers: Go to previous marker/project start  
	  Loop points: Set start point  
	  Markers: Go to next marker/project end  
	  Loop points: Set end point  
	  Go to start of loop
	  
	To jump to a segment marker
	
	A. Either use the native functionality:  
	
	1. Select segment start/end time stamp in the Notes (can be 
	double clicked) and copy it
	2. Double click the Transport or run Ctrl+J shortcut (default)  
	3. Paste the copied time stamp into the dialogue field  
	4. Click OK or hit Enter  
	
	OR
	
	B. Use the script 'BuyOne_Transcribing - Go to segment marker.lua'
	
	C. (Less convenient)
	
	1. Have the Ruler time unit set to Minutes:Seconds  
	2. Copy the time stamp from the segment data  
	3. Open the Region/Marker manager  
	4. Make sure the manager setting 'Seek playback when selecting a marker or region'
		is enabled  
	5. Paste the time stamp into the filter field of the manager
	6. Click the marker entry in the manager		
	
	
	To focus on auditioning a segment:  
	
	1. Enable the following actions:  
	Transport: Toggle stop playback at end of loop if repeat is disabled (available since build 4.30)  
	OR  
	Xenakios/SWS: [Deprecated] Toggle stop playback at end of loop  
	2. Set loop points to the segment using the custom action from step 1 of par. B above.  
	3. Hit Play to audition, at the end of the loop the play cursor will  
	return to the original position  

	To stop playback in the middle of the segment use  
	
	EITHER  
	Transport: Play/pause
	OR  
	Transport: Pause
