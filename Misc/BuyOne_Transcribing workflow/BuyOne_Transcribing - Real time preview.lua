ReaScript name: BuyOne_Transcribing - Real time preview.lua
Author: BuyOne
Website: https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=134058 or https://github.com/Buy-One/REAPER-scripts/issues
Version: 1.5
Changelog:  1.5 #Fixed duplication of preview items when there're gaps between segments					
		#Made the script ignore non-segment markers following segment markers
		#Segments with no transcript no longer affect timing of preview item creation
		#Changed the location of preview items when the transport is stopped
		so that they're created for the segment immediately at the edit cursor rather than the next one
		#Made preview item creation more consistent with the original concept
		#Updated 'About' text
 	  1.4 	#Fixed time stamp formatting as hours:minutes:seconds.milliseconds
	  1.3 	#Added character escaping to NOTES_TRACK_NAME setting evaluation to prevent errors caused unascaped characters
	  1.2 	#Included explicit undo point creation mechanism when a new preview item is placed on the preview track
		#Fixed error when the project is reloaded while the script is running
		#Optimized Video processor source track creation function
		#Added OVERLAY_PRESET setting validation
		#Updated About text
	  1.1 	#Added overlay preset availability evaluation in builds 7.20 and newer
		#Optimized undo point creation in cases where overlay preset isn't found
		#Fixed error when the preview track is deleted manually before the script is terminated

	alongside 
	BuyOne_Transcribing - Create and manage segments (MAIN).lua

	meant to display the transcript segment by segment in real time
	while REAPER is in play mode or when the edit cursor is located
	within segment markers.			

	The original transcript is retrieved from the Notes of tracks
	whose name is defined in the NOTES_TRACK_NAME setting and is 
	reproduced segment by segment in the Notes of a track defined 
	in the PREVIEW_TRACK_NAME setting. 
	
	When the script is launched the SWS Notes window is auto-opened
	being focused on the preview track unless it's already open and
	unless INSERT_PREVIEW_ITEMS setting is enabled.
	
	If INSERT_PREVIEW_ITEMS setting is enabled, on the preview track 
	an empty item is placed with an instance of the Video processor 
	plugin inserted in its FX chain with the preset defined in the 
	OVERLAY_PRESET setting activated to be able to preview the transcript 
	segment by segment within video context when Video window is open. 
	The segment text is fed into the item name.  
	To have text displayed within the Video window the preview track 
	must be located above the track with a video item.  
	The preview items are added dynamically to accommodate segment
	which follows the currently active segment determined by the 
	location of the edit or play cursor relative to the segment start 
	marker. Therefore while the transport is in play mode, in order to 
	insert a preview item for a particular segment without waiting until 
	it'll be added in the course of the playback, move the edit cursor 
	to the location immediately preceding the segment start marker.  
	This mechanism of proactive preview item creation has been devised 
	to overcome Video processor limitation which prevents it from 
	processing changes in track/take names as soon as the change occurs 
	so it must be allowed to process the content in advance. They're
	created dynamically to be able to reflect any changes made to the
	transcript in real time.  
	If everything functions properly, during playback there should be 
	no more than 2 preview items on the prevew track at any given moment, 
	one for the current and another for the next segment. There'll be 
	only 1 when the last segment is being played and when the cursor 
	is located to the left of the very first segment marker.	 
	When the transport is stopped, in order to have a preview item 
	created for a particular segment place the edit cursor directly 
	within the bounds of the relevant segment region, i.e. at its start
	marker or between its start and end markers.
	
	The script relies on markers location to display segment text.
	If segment start marker time stamp contained in the marker's name 
	doesn't match its actual position on the time line, a message 
	stating the fact will be displayed in the preview track Notes 
	instead of the actual segment transcript, if any.  
	Preview items for such segments and for segments with no segment
	transcript are not created.  
	The length of the preview items is determined by the distance 
	between current segment start marker and the next valid marker.			
	If segment end marker time stamp contained in the marker's name
	doesn't match its actual position, the preview item will still be
	created but its length will be limited by such marker regardless
	of the end time stamp listed in the segment data in the Notes, 
	if any. When such marker is passed by the play or edit cursor 
	the message stating its position and time stamp mismatch will 
	be displayed in the preview track Notes.  
	If there's no explicit segment end marker, the preview item will
	extend to the start marker of the next valid segment.  
	Non-segment markers (those which don't contain in their name 
	a time stamp in the format supported by Transcribing set of scripts) 
	are ignored.  
	The duration of a segment transcript display in the Notes 
	of the preview track is independent of the preview items length
	and of gaps between segments and lasts until the next segment
	start marker comes along. For this reason viewing transcript
	in the preview track Notes isn't very suitable for working with 
	video where timely going out of captions may be important.  
	If you're not sure whether all current segment markers positions
	match time stamps in the transcript or their own time stamps 
	included in their names, run the script
	'BuyOne_Transcribing - Prepare transcript for rendering.lua'
	to re-create the marker array. Then the render track created by
	that script can be deleted. Or use the script
	'BuyOne_Transcribing - Create and manage segments (MAIN).lua'
	in 'Batch segment update' mode described in par. F of its 'About' 
	text. 
	
	The script must run in the background which it will after the 
	initial launch. To terminate it, launch it again and click 
	'Terminate instances' button in the ReaScript task control dialogue 
	which will pop up. Before doing this it's recommended to checkmark 
	'Remember my answer for this script option' so from then on the 
	script is terminated automatically.
	
	While the script runs a toolbar button linked to it is lit and 
	a menu item is ticked.
	
	The script only works under the project tab it's originally been
	launched under. To use it in another project tab terminate it 
	and re-launch under it.  
	
	For preview another script can be used, which is
	'BuyOne_Transcribing - Prepare transcript for rendering.lua'
	however it's not as flexible as this one, because it recreates
	all segment markers from scratch based on the Notes content
	and ignores segments with no transcript. If segments have been
	updated it will have to be run again to recreate markers based
	on the updated Notes data.  
	On the other hand this script creates redundant undo points each
	time a new preview item is inserted which cannot be prevented 
	and which increase and lengthen the undo history unnecessarily. 
	So it may be a good idea to use it in a project copy rathen than 
	directly in the main project. 
	
	
	IMPORTANT
	
	BE AWARE THAT SWS NOTES CHANGES WHICH IMMEDIATELY PRECEDE
	OR FOLLOW REAPER STATE CHANGE WILL GET UNDONE IF SUCH REAPER 
	STATE CHANGE IS UNDONE.
	This has been reported to the SWS team
	https://github.com/reaper-oss/sws/issues/1880
	https://github.com/reaper-oss/sws/issues/1812
	https://github.com/reaper-oss/sws/issues/1743
	THEREFORE SAVING OFTEN IS SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT BEACAUSE IT WILL
	ALLOW RESTORATION OF NOTES CHANGES LOST AFTER UNDO, BY MEANS 
	OF PROJECT RELOAD.
	ALTERNATIVELY, IF PREVIOUS STATE CAN BE RESTORED WITHOUT RESORTING
	TO UNDO IT'S ADVISED TO OPT FOR THIS METHOD.
