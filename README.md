# REAPER-scripts
Lua scripts for Cockos' REAPER 

**Many scripts feature user settings. Almost all include guide or description of features. Be sure to check those out and configure to your liking.**

[Complete list (159)](https://github.com/Buy-One/REAPER-scripts/wiki/SCRIPT-LIST)

[Download all](https://github.com/Buy-One/REAPER-scripts/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

To download an individual script:
1. Enter the folder
2. Click the script link
3. Click "Raw" button in the upper right corner of the script window
4. Download as normal
5. Remove the .txt extension only leaving .lua
6. Or use the download button which has appeared in the updated interface


Scripts from the **MIDI** folder go to the **MIDI Editor** section of the Action list  

Updating scripts which include USER SETTINGS, in order to retain them, first overwrite the entire USER SETTINGS section in the newer version of the script with the one from the old one and only then overwrite the actual file.

**Since this repo isn't compatible with ReaPack, if you have a Gihub account you can subscribe to the repo under the *Watch* button to be able to receive updates. To only get updates regarding new scripts and newer versions, under *Custom* submenu of the *Watch* menu enable only options *Pull requests* and *Releases*.** 

**Something to be aware of is that scripts marked with META in their name are supposed to work as individual scripts under different names listed in the META script header, because their functionality depends on the name. If you feel adventerous you're welcome to create their multiple copies having named them according to the names listed inside.**

_REAPER is a DAW able to mimic the look and feel of other DAWs. If you so wish, with the ReaScript API, scheduled ProTools crashes can again be made integral part of your workflow._
