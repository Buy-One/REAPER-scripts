# REAPER-scripts
Lua scripts for Cockos' REAPER 

**Many scripts feature user settings. Almost all include guide or description of features. Be sure to check those out and configure to your liking.**

**From now on scripts marked with META in their name, when executed export individual scripts included in the META package into the directory they themeslves reside in AND automatically import them into the Action list.**

**Script batch installation and transfer of per script user settings from their older versions to the newer ones before updating the actual files can be done semi-automatically with the script `BuyOne_Script updater and installer.lua`, which should be installed first. Refer to the detailed instructions inside that script.**

To download an individual script:
1. Enter the folder
2. Click the script link
3. Click "Raw" button in the upper right corner of the script window

Scripts from the **MIDI** folder go to the **MIDI Editor** section of the Action list  

If you don't use `BuyOne_Script updater and installer.lua` to transfer user settings to newer versions of scripts, the before manually updating scripts which include USER SETTINGS, in order to retain them overwrite the entire USER SETTINGS section in the newer version of the script with the one from the old one and only then overwrite the actual file.
