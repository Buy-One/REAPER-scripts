ReaScript name: BuyOne_Create bus track for selected tracks and their send destination tracks.lua
Author: BuyOne
Website: https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=134058 or https://github.com/Buy-One/REAPER-scripts/issues
Version: 1.0
Changelog: #Initial release
Licence: WTFPL
About: 	Creates a bus track from track selection.
	Can be used to convert a folder of tracks into a bus track
	or to create a bus track for submix rendering.

	RULES

	1. If ROUTE_SEND_DESTINATION_TRACKS setting is enabled all 
	send destination tracks of selected tracks and their own send 
	destination tracks are routed to the bus track.  
	2. Selected and send destination tracks whose Master/Parent
	send AKA Master send (depending on REAPER build) is disabled
	aren't routed to the bus track.  
	3. Selected folder child tracks aren't routed to the bus track if
	at least one parent track of theirs is also selected and has 
	its Master/Parent send AKA Master send (depending on REAPER build) 
	enabled.  
	4. if ROUTE_SEND_DESTINATION_TRACKS setting is enabled send destination 
	tracks of child tracks in a folder whose parent track is routed 
	to the bus track are also routed to the bus track.

	The bus track is created immediately above the first track which
	has been routed to it.

	If ROUTE_SEND_DESTINATION_TRACKS setting is enabled and you'd like
	to look up send destination tracks which have been routed to the
	bus track along with the selected tracks, use the script  
	BuyOne_Navigate to track send destination or receive source track via menu.lua
	which will generate a menu where they will be listed under 'Receives:'
